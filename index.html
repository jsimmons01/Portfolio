							<h3>HTML,CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap</h3>
							<p>I created this website for a client so he can have a website. I learned how to use a boilerplate and make it my own. At first I thought using a boilerplate was going to be easy, but it takes effort to make the wanted customizations. I learned that depending on the website sometimes it’s easier to build it from scratch. I used a boilerplate because I wanted to save time by not worrying about the basic design. One of the customizations I made was a music playlist updatings HTML’s plain audio player using JavaScript.

						<header><h1>My Story</h1></header>		
					<p>How does a teacher become a developer? My story is very simple, I have always had an interest in programming.  It started in 2009 when I took intro to computer science in college. I learned Java it was my 1st time being introduced to coding. I really enjoyed doing the projects, but since it didn’t come naturally to me like it did for other students, I thought I wasn’t good and didn’t pursue it further.</p>

						<p>In 2020 I did a coding workshop where I learned to build a static landing page with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I really enjoyed it. This reignited my interest in coding and since then I have been improving my skills in object oriented programming and web development. So to answer the question how does a teacher become a web developer, is quite simple. My passion was lying doormat because I had the wrong impression.</p>
						
						<p>After taking the coding workshop I spent a few months self-teaching because I decided I wanted to pursue this career path. I joined Nucamp Bootcamp so I can have structure and put my best foot forward. I spent at least 4 hours everyday most times more, even on weekends coding, practicing, and learning. 
						
							I have definitely grown as a developer since the boot camp. Some of the difficult concepts that I didn’t understand while taking the boot camp it makes sense know and comes easy. </p>
						
						<p>I am now seeking a full-time role where I can contribute my skills in web development and use my transferable soft skills as a teacher (effective communication, continous learning, problem solving) to help a compay achieve their goals. </p>
