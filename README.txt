# My Portfolio 

## Descritption

My portfolio showcases all the projects demonstrating my HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React skills. 

## What I learned

I learned how to take the necessary items I needed from a  boilerplate and make the website my own. Everything is not about doing things from scratch. As a mother and wife my duties don't go away because I want to change careers. Time management is important. It is more important for me to show that I can create a CRUD app.
